#####

1: You should't use anonymous ports (a.k.a. ephemeral ports) to implement a UDP or TCP service.

By default, these ports are in the range 32768 - 65535.

# ndd /dev/tcp tcp_smallest_anon_port
32768
# ndd /dev/tcp tcp_largest_anon_port 
65535
2: Unless your service is running as root or has the required RBAC privilege, you shouldn't use a privileged port. By default all ports from 1 to 1024 are privileged:

# ndd /dev/tcp tcp_smallest_nonpriv_port
1024
3: Unless you know what you are doing, you shouldn't use a well known port that is expected to run a different service than the one you plan to. Well known ports are listed in /etc/services. eg:

# tail /etc/services
dtspc           6112/tcp                        # CDE subprocess control
fs              7100/tcp                        # Font server
solaris-audit   16162/tcp                       # Secure remote audit logging
servicetag      6481/udp
servicetag      6481/tcp
wnn6            22273/tcp                       # Wnn6 jserver
wnn6            22273/udp                       # Wnn6 jserver
rdc             121/tcp                         # SNDR server daemon
snmpd           161/udp        snmp             # Net-SNMP snmp daemon
swat            901/tcp                         # Samba Web Adm.Tool
4: You shouldn't use a port that is already used by an existing service. You can get these with running:

# netstat -an | grep LISTEN | nawk '{$0=$1;gsub(".*\\.","");print}' | sort -un
5: Finally, you shouldn't use a port used by a service currently disabled but that might be enabled in the future. This is the trickiest part to comply with...

> lsof -i :8000
    * see which program is using the port 8080

> netstat -an | grep LISTEN
    * see all the ports that are listening to sth

> netstat -plunt | grep <process name>
    * check the port name for a process
    * e.g > netstat -plunt | grep mysql
