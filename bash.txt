MISC:
* if we want to execute more than one command in one line then seperate commands by ";" in the same line

VARIABLES:
* no spaces betn variable name and equals to sign also no space betn equals to sign and value
e.g 
> A=14
* use unset to make a variable uninitialized
e.g 
> unset A
* to print a variable use $ infront of a variable name 
e.g
echo $myVar

* shell keeps variables in two different areas, 
    * the area called environment or the exported variables -> these variables are copied to new processes, shells that we run
        * if we want to assign a variable and then run a shell program to get a value from that variable then we need to export the variable
        e.g
        > export var2="var2 value"
        * this puts var2 in the shell's environment
        * every new process or shell gets a copy of this variable "var2" not the reference, they are not shared
        * this can also be done using the syntax to export something 
        > declare -x var2
        * to export a function
        > export -f functionName
        To see which things has been exported to the environment(only exported) in bash use "export"
        > export  
    * 

GROUPING IN BASH:
    * parenthesis starts a new process
    e.g suppose
    a=1
    (
    a=2
    )
    echo $a
    * this prints 1
    * this is happeinig in a new copy or a process
    * when the parenthesis is closed, what ever happens inside the parenthesis is gone    
        
 
    * curly braces dont start a new process
    e.g suppose
    a=1
    {
    a=2
    }
    echo $a
    * this prints 2 
    * curly braces doesnt start a new process
    

MISC:
* type "enable" to get builtin commands list
> enable 
* to list all keywords type "compgen -k"
> compgen -k 
    list all keywords

BASH : bash_rc and bash_profile
* when gets started it gets some initialization variables from various files some of them are
    .bash_profile -> read just when bash is started when u login
    .bashrc -> executed everytime a shell is started

    certain things are appropriate in .bash_profile some are appropriate in .brashrc

    > setting environment variables are done in .bash_profile not .bashrc
    e.g if you extend an exproted variable like PATH in .bashrc, it will grow with each nested shell invocation 
    PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin -> this command concatinates "usr/local/bin" to the PATH variable 
    this would keep adding /usr/local/bin to the end of PATH within nested shells
    will concatinate 
    > alias and functions are not normally exported, they are not defined in .bash_profile, cuz u want it in every shell so they are defined in .bashrc

    > Ubuntu uses .profile instead of .bash_profile, if u create ur own .bash_profile then .profile will not be read

* it doesnt hurt to export a variable which is already exported


SOURCING:
> source example.sh or .<space>example.sh -> to source a script
    * whe u source a script, ur current shell just interprets the commands inside the source script as if they were done themselves, in contrast to starting a new process to run the script
    * when a script is sourced and if script the script does things like assign the value to a variable, then this is happening in calling script only
    * example sourcing is done to import variable, assignments or functions
    * the source script is executed within  the calling shell's process

ALIASING:
* defining alternatives to long commands e.g. "ll" for "ls -l"
* for commands not for general strings
e.g
> alias mroe=more
> alias gs="git status"
* to unalias an alias
> unalias <alias name>
> unalias mroe


ECHO:
* -n dont print the trailing new line
* -e enable backslash escaped characters like \n and \t
* -E disable backslash escaped characters in case they were enabled by default 

* one common use is to redirect the output to a file or stdout or stderr
e.g 
> echo "Warning!" >&2
this means send standard output to the same place as file number 2 which is standard error
> is redirect standard output 
& what comes next is a file descriptor not a file (only for right hand side of >)
2 is stderr file descriptor
here we are basically redirecting stdout from echo command to stderr
e.g
> echo "Hey" >2
here we are outputting "hey" to a file called 2

LOCAL VARIABLE AND TYPESET
# typeset command
* local variables can be declared as local to function by using "typeset" keyword
* typeset also can provide a type or can provide formatting
e.g
> typeset -i x
here -i tells that x should be declared as an integer
* if declared as an integer then we can use integer operations like 
    let x++; let y=x**2; let x=x*3; let x*=5; ...
* also integer operations are 10x faster
* here let allows for convenient arithmetic

# declare command
> declare -l 
    whenever string is assigned to a variable then any uppercase letters in the string are converted into lowercase
> declare -u 
    whenever string is assigned to a variable then any lowercase letters in the string are converted into uppercase
> declare -r 
    variable is made read-only, value is given in declare statement
> decalre -a arr 
    variable arr is declared as an array, 
> declare -A arr
    variable arr is declared as an associative array
* to access array elements use {}
e.g 
> ${arr[0]}
> ${arr["user"]}

READ COMMAND
* lets read input to stdin into variables
* breaks up the input based on white space
e.g
> read a b
a will get the first word 
b will get the rest of the line
e.g
> read a b c
a will get the first word
b will get the second word
c will get the rest og the line

WHILE LOOP

while
    command list 1
do 
    command list 
done

* if the last command in the "command list 1" is successful or true then we do the sequence of commands in the "command list"

e.g
while
    ((x<10))
do
    echo loop $x; date >date.$x
    ((x=x+1))
done

* here 10 files are created and the value of date is written in all the files data.1, data.2, ...

e.g
while
    read a b
do
echo a is $a b is $b
done <data_file

* here we read the input, first word goes to a and rest of the line goes to b
* in the "done" part we are telling "while" to take the input from the file called "data_file"
* when do the read, the values are comming out of "data_file"
* first iteration reads the first line of the file
* second iteration reads the second line of the file and so on
* the read command will be successful if it reads sth
* when we run out of lines i.e reach EOF in the file, then the loop stops

e.g
ls -l | while
    read a b c d
    do
        echo owner is $c
    done

* here we are piping result of "ls -l" into while
* while loop runs for all the files present

FOR LOOOPS

syntax:
for <var> in <list>
do
    command list
done

e.g 
for i in dog rat elephant
do 
    echo i is $i
done

output:
dog
rat
elephant

COMMAND sqe:

e.g
> seq 1 5
output:
1 2 3 4 5
* prints out numbers seperated by white spaces

for num in `seq 1 5`
    # loops over 1 2 3 4 5

* bash runs the command with the back ticks "`"
* if "new line" was present in the output of the commands executed within the  back ticks then it is converted into "spaces"
* remember for loop takes space to distinguish different values

* bash can generate sequences with {}
e.g {A..Z}
creates A B ...
e.g. {1..10}
creates 1 2 ...

e.g
for d in $(<data_file)
    #loops over space/newLine
    #seperated data in data_file
* "$(" is an alternative to back ticks "`"
* "<data_file" -> cat the data_file i.e the whole contents of data_file is going to be substituted back in the for loop

e.g.
for j in *.c
    #making a list with file globbing
* any file with .c extension

e.g. 
for f in $(find . -name *.c)
    # using a command to generate a list
* find command is going to go to all sub directories and find any file with extension .c

FUNCTIONS

syntax
function printhello {
    echo Hello
}

> printhello
* shell memorizes the function like its a new command, so typing the function name in the command line executes the function
* <space> is necessary after the function and before "{" during function declaration
* functions are commands that can produce output
* return from a function can be captured like this
> hvar=$(printhello)
or
> hvar=`printhello`

COMMAND return
* used to return from a function

COMMAND exit
> exit <VALUE>
* exit command used to terminate a whole shell script
* can be used to return a exit status
* if exit status not defined by the programmer then it defaults to 0
* 0 means success, non 0 is failure
* exit status can be checked by special bash variable "$?"

REDIRECTION AND PIPES

* processes normally have three files open:
    0 => stdin,
    1 => stdout,
    3 => stderr
* when we execute a command and use ">" or "2>" or "<", they mean:
    * > telling the shell to redirect the stdout of that command to a specific file
        e.g > file
    * 2> telling the shell to redirect the stderr of that command to a specific file
        e.g 2> file
    * < telling the shell to redirect the input from keyboard to a specified file
* &> means redirect both stdout and stderr to a specified file

* if file is overwritten or created ! be careful

#Pipe "|"
* command | command2
    * command2's stdin comes from command's stdout

* command 2>&1 | command2
    * "2>&1" redirect stderr at the same place as the stdout
    * since we have a pipe, stdout is going into the pipe
    * since we are using "2>&1", both stderr and stdout are going to the pipe

* command |& command2
    * alternative way for command2 to get command's stdout  and stderr as its stdin
    * this may not work in all shells, works in bash

* command >> file
    * appends stdout of command to end of file, file doesnt exist then, file is created otherwise appended 

* command &>> file
    * appends stdout and stderr of command to end of file, file doesnt exit then, file is created otherwise appended

* <<
